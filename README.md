# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

Accessibility in programming is designing web pages with the intent and mindfulness of allowing anyone to view your webpage, regardless of physical ability or lack thereof.

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 

To make a website accessible, a website design needs a viewport meta tag in its HTML head, media queries in the bottom of its CSS, and semantic HTML with complete alt tags.

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

A variable is a container that store any type of data that can be called upon later on. There are 3 different variable names each with it own rules and uses. The Var type is a variable that can be reassigned and redeclared, but is function scoped. The Let type can also be reassigned, but cannot be redeclared and is block scoped. THe final form, Const type, can be neither redeclared or reassigned and is also block scoped. 

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

The purpose of using functions in coding is essentially to make a programmers life easier. A function can be invoked in code as many times as needed and can be used for many elements within a code.  Functions save a lot of time by replacing lines upon lines of hard coded information, so instead of having to repeat yourself over and over again, it helps to keep your code DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself)

5. How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?

There are 2 ways to access the key of an object in an array. The first is dot notation, you call the key by writing out the array name followed by a '.' and the key name: (array.key;)
The second form is bracket notation, which is written out with the array name followed by the string of the key inside brackets: (array['key'];) 

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
![alt text](assets/tests_debug_terminal_final.png "your terminal should look like this")

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [ ] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
